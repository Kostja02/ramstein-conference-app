<p>
  The functions explained below are tested with firefox and Chrome, both on Android and MacOS.
  They should work on other browsers too, but no guarantee for that :)
</p>
<p>
  PS: If you tested it on Safari and/or Edge, let me know!

<!-- <h2>Push-Notifications</h2>
<p>
  The buttons below trigger push notifications. If you accidentally clicked "Deny" on the browser
  popup asking to allow Notifications, you can re-enable them inside the site-settings (click on
  the lock left of the URL). Note that the second button sends a notification to ALL subscribers.
</p>
<p>
  Please not that there is a limit in sending notifications that is managed by the browser, so
  don't send too much or too shortly after one another because there is a good chance you will
  be blocked by some browsers...
</p>
<p>These buttons are for showcase purpose only and will not be part of the final application.</p>
<div fxLayout="row wrap" fxLayoutGap="32px" fxLayoutAlign="center">
  <button mat-raised-button color="primary" (click)="subscribeToNotifications()">
    Subscribe to Notifications
  </button>
  <button mat-raised-button color="secondary" (click)="sendNotification()">
    Send Notification to all Subscribers
  </button>
</div> -->

<h2>Add to homescreen</h2>
<p>
  You should see a "Add to Homescreen" Bar in mobile browsers. By clicking on it, you can (surprise)
  add the app to your homescreen or list of apps. It should then also work offline.
</p>

<h2>Language</h2>
<p>
  This app is planned to be released in English and German but right now, there is no German version ;)
