<h1>Help section</h1>
<p>
  The functions explained below are tested with firefox and Chrome, both on Android and MacOS.
  They should work on other browsers too, but no guarantee for that :)
</p>
<p>
  PS: If you tested it on Safari and/or Edge, let me know!
</p>

<h2>Push-Notifications</h2>
<p>
  On the first load, a dialog box at the bottom asks you for enabling push-notifications. If
  you accidentally clicked "Deny", you can re-enable them inside the site-settings (click on
  the lock left of the URL).
</p>

<h2>Add to homescreen</h2>
<p>
  You should see a "Add to Homescreen" Bar in mobile browsers. By clicking on it, you can (surprise)
  add the app to your homescreen or list of apps. It should then also work offline.
</p>

<h2>Language</h2>
<p>
  You can switch the language with the buttons below:
</p>
<mat-button-toggle-group [value]="translateService.currentLang">
  <mat-button-toggle value="de" (change)="changeLanguage($event.value)">
    German
  </mat-button-toggle>
  <mat-button-toggle value="en" (change)="changeLanguage($event.value)">
    English
  </mat-button-toggle>
</mat-button-toggle-group>
